# Hand Gesture Recognition using Deep Learning

This project implements a **hand gesture recognition model** that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data.  
It enables intuitive **human-computer interaction** and gesture-based control systems.

The model is trained on the [LEAP Gestures Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) from Kaggle.

---

## Features

- Recognizes multiple hand gestures from images or real-time video.
- Uses a **deep learning model** (CNN or other architecture) for gesture classification.
- Supports **webcam-based real-time inference**.
- Shows predicted gesture on live video feed.
- Can be extended for gesture-based control of applications or devices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
```

## How to Run Webcam Inference

```bash
Ensure your webcam is connected.

Run the inference script:

python webcam_gesture_recognition.py


A window will appear showing the webcam feed with the predicted gesture label overlaid on the video.

```
